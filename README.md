# flower-classification-on-images-using-deep-learning-techniques
The architecture which is used for flower recognition based on the VGG16 architecture, which is a popular CNN architecture for image recognition tasks. The VGG16 architecture consists of 13 convolutional layers, 5 pooling layers, and 3 fully connected layers.
Applications of classification of flowers can be found useful in floriculture, flower searching for patent analysis, etc. Floriculture has become one of the important commercial trades in agriculture owing to a steady increase in the demand for flowers.
